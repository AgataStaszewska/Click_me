A simple game made for practice

Since I am currently on my deathbed dying from an acute instance of the Common Cold, I decided to make a game, just for practice (I am quite a beginner, but still: I thought it would be more complicated than just an HTML/JS thing, oh well.)

Feel free to comment and/or suggest any changes/improvements.

THE RULES:
After clicking on the Start button, a random button from the grid turns red. The player has then to click on this button. The player gets a point, the button turns blue again, and another one turns red. The player has to click on the new red button, and gets a point.
Now, there are two versions of the game: in the first one, the player has 30 seconds, then the game finishes, and the player gets points collected within this time.
In the second version, the player has 1 second to click the next red button, should they fail - the game ends, and the player gets points.

To switch between versions: comment/uncomment marked lines in app.js

The Game is over after the player fails to click on the red button within set time. Ta-daaa!
