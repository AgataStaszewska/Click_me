A simple game made for practice

Since I am currently on my deathbed dying from the acute instance of the Common Cold, I decided to make a game, just for practice (I am quite a beginner, but still: I thought it would be more complicated than just a HTML/JS thing, oh well.)

Feel free to comment and/or suggest any changes/improvements.

THE RULES:
After clicking on the Start button, a random button from the grid turns red. The player has then to click on this button. The player gets a point, the button turns blue again, and another one turns red. The player has to click on the new red button, and gets a point. Each time the player clicks the new red button, the time he has to do so is reduced by a 0.01 of a second. The Game is over after the player fails to click on the red button within set time. Ta-daaa!
